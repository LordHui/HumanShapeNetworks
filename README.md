# HumanShapeNetworks

A CNN trained to recognize the human shape PCA parameters.
Example inputs are included in data file. 
The output of the network is a 20 dimension vector which numbers correspond to PCA eigenvectors weights. 
For details of the method, please check the paper "HS-Nets : Estimating Human Body Shape from Silhouettes with Convolutional Neural Networks".
For data generation, please contact me.
